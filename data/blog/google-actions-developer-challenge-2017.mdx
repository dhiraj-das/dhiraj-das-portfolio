## Introduction

It was sometime in May 2017 that Google had launched Google Assistant, a conversational assistant that allowed Android users to automate everydays tasks by talking to it. As a technology enthusiast and an iOS developer, I was conviced this technology had a lot of potential and wanted to fully explore this technology.

## Launch of Google Actions Developer Challenge 2017

Google had announced a hackathon - Google Assistant Developer Challenge 2017 to encourage developers across the world to build custom apps (actions) for the Google Assistant. With eligible participants entering to $10,000 in prizes including a paid trip to Google I/O 2018, this sounded too good to be true.

## Children's developmental milestones

[Yasin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasinemanee/) was a friend whom I met during my college days. Although he was a doctor by profession, we shared a common interest in solving different problems by using technology as an enabler.

As such, he was the go-to person for me to discuss about this challenge. Yasin shared his experiences with many of his patients who were first time parents and would often had to travel 300-400kms to confirm whether their child is growing well and achieving the developmental milestones associated with their child's age.

We were instantly convinced that an action on Google Assistant that enabled parents to check their children's developmental milestones would help a lot of parents at least as a screening tool.

## Developing Babysteps

The following months were full of challenges and dissapointments. As a new technology, there was very limited support available on the internet for developing an action. To make things more challenging, although I was well versed with other programming languages, such as Swift and Java, Javascript coupled with the task of creating a serverless cloud function was very new to me.

Many thanks to the google assistant support email which used to respond to my queries and helped me whenever I was stuck.

After months of development and revisions, we were able to submit our app, and get it approved by the Google Assistant team for publishing it publicly. We recieved a decent MAU of around 500-1k users after our initial launch.
